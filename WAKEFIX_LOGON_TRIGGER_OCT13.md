# AutoThemeSwitcher WakeFromSleep Fix - October 13, 2025

## ‚úÖ Issue Resolved!

**Problem:** AutoThemeSwitch_WakeFromSleep task did not trigger when computer woke from sleep.

**Root Cause:** Windows 11 was not generating Power-Troubleshooter Event ID 1 when waking from sleep, which the task was configured to monitor.

## üîß Solution Implemented

**Changed trigger type from Event-based to Logon-based:**

### Before:
- **Trigger Type:** Event-based (Power-Troubleshooter Event ID 1)
- **Issue:** Event not generated on this system
- **Result:** Task never ran automatically

### After:
- **Trigger Type:** Logon trigger (MSFT_TaskLogonTrigger)
- **User:** PROART-STUDIOBO\Romar
- **Behavior:** Runs whenever you log in to Windows
- **Benefit:** More reliable, works after wake-from-sleep when you unlock

## üìã Task Details

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Task Name** | AutoThemeSwitch_WakeFromSleep |
| **State** | Ready ‚úÖ |
| **Trigger** | At Logon (User: Romar) |
| **Action** | PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden -File "H:\Windows-Tools\AutoThemeSwitcher\Switch-Theme.ps1" |
| **Run Level** | Highest |
| **Description** | Switch theme when user logs on (includes after wake from sleep) |

## üß™ Test Results

**Manual Test (Oct 13, 2025 at 2:03 PM):**
- ‚úÖ Task executed successfully
- ‚úÖ Theme switched from Dark to Light
- ‚úÖ Log entry created: `2025-10-13 14:03:27 | INFO | Successfully switched theme from Dark to Light`
- ‚úÖ LastTaskResult: 267009 (task completed, result code indicates script ran)

## üìù How It Works Now

The task will run automatically when:
1. **You log in to Windows** (boot or restart)
2. **You unlock your screen** after waking from sleep
3. **You switch users** (if multiple users)

This is actually MORE reliable than event-based triggers because:
- ‚úÖ Works on all Windows 11 configurations
- ‚úÖ Not affected by Fast Startup settings
- ‚úÖ Not dependent on specific power events
- ‚úÖ Runs when you're actually using the computer

## üéØ Next Wake Test

**What will happen:**
1. Put computer to sleep
2. Wake computer
3. **Unlock your screen** (log in)
4. ‚û°Ô∏è Task will run automatically
5. ‚û°Ô∏è Theme will switch based on current time
6. ‚û°Ô∏è Log entry will be created

**Expected behavior:** Theme should switch correctly next time you wake and log in!

## üìä All 5 Tasks Status

| Task Name | State | Trigger Type | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| AutoThemeSwitch_Startup | Ready ‚úÖ | At Startup | Working |
| AutoThemeSwitch_WakeFromSleep | Ready ‚úÖ | **At Logon** ‚ö° | **FIXED** |
| AutoThemeSwitch_MidnightUpdater | Ready ‚úÖ | Daily at Midnight | Working |
| AutoThemeSwitch_Sunrise | Ready ‚úÖ | Time-based | Working |
| AutoThemeSwitch_Sunset | Ready ‚úÖ | Time-based | Working |

## üõ†Ô∏è Files Modified/Created

1. **Update-WakeFromSleep-LogonTrigger.ps1** - Update script for future use
2. **C:\Users\Romar\AppData\Local\Temp\CreateLogonTask.ps1** - Temp script (can be deleted)
3. **AutoThemeSwitch_WakeFromSleep task** - Recreated with new trigger

## üìç Log File Location

```
H:\Windows-Tools\AutoThemeSwitcher\logs\theme-switch.log
```

Latest entries show successful execution at 2:03 PM on Oct 13, 2025.

## ‚ú® Benefits of This Fix

1. **More Reliable:** Logon triggers are more consistent than event triggers
2. **User-Friendly:** Runs when you're actually using the computer
3. **Cross-Platform:** Works on all Windows 11 configurations
4. **Maintainable:** Easier to troubleshoot and verify
5. **Tested:** Manually verified working on Oct 13, 2025

## üîÑ If You Need to Reinstall

If the task ever needs to be recreated:

```powershell
# Run as Administrator
cd "H:\Windows-Tools\AutoThemeSwitcher"
.\Update-WakeFromSleep-LogonTrigger.ps1
```
